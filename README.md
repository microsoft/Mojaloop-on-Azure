# Mojaloop on Azure

This project provides a set of deployment and code assets to enable the deployment of the Mojaloop payment interoperability solution natively on Azure, leveraging Azure Platform-as-a-Services capablities.

The assets held here should be used as a starting point for a deployment of Mojaloop on Azure. The solution as-is is not intended to provide a comprehensive "Production Ready" or "Scale Ready" version of the platform, and care should be takem to assess your own needs with regard to scalability and scaling methods, security, operations and additional capabilities, e.g. consolidated operational monitoring.
